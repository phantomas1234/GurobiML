GurobiML provides a MathLink interface to Gurobi's LP/MIP solvers. It provides
high and low entry points to the solvers' functionalities, for example,
`GurobiSolve` is a high level function that mimics Mathematica's own
`LinearProgramming` function's argument signature.

Reached milestones:

- Quadratic programming capabilities

Milestones:

1. Documentation (high and low level functions)
2. Provide cross platform installation instructions
